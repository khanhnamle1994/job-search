/*
The time complexity of this solution is O(n * nT) where n is the number of items and
T is the total amount of time we have.

We have to recursively find the optimal solution for each time from 0 to the total time
we have, and for each recursive call we have to consider each item in the list of items.
And for each item we consider, we have to calculate the total XP.

At the cost of being less clear, we could refactor the solution to not calculate total XP
every time. This would make our solution O(nT).

The space complexity is O(nT) because there are T function scopes created by recursive calls
and each scope stores an array with up to n times.
